# In processing raw text, itâ€™s quite often necessary to clean and normalize the text before doing anything else. 
#If you want to find the frequency of words in text, for example, you can make the job easier if, before you start counting, 
#you make sure that everything is lowercase (or uppercase, if you prefer) and that all punctuation has been removed. 
#You can also make things easier by breaking the text into a series of words. In this lab,the task is to read 
#the first part of the first chapter of Moby Dick (found in the book's source code), make sure that everything is one case,
#remove all punctuation, and write the words one per line to a second file
